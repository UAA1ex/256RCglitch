# 256 RC glitch
The connection is divided into 2 groups, a total of 8 gates can be used as input and output signals, the visual connection is described in the PNG file in the repository.

Connection group 1:
[Vanilla red gradient - vanilla blue gradient]
> 68FF88 - 7EEDED 
> 19E753 - 2CE6E6
> 0E8031 - 118787
> 064023 - 0A4444

Connection group 2:
[Vanilla green gradient - vanilla cyan gradient]
> 4C6FE3 - F06767
> 0A3EE2 - D02525
> 0F2E91 - 7C0000
> 0A1D5A - 560202

The color of the "repeater":

222222 [vanilla black] 
*Repeater or antena it's 255 logic gates painted black on your creation.

These colors can NOT be used to color any objects capable of being connected on creation, except for those that will be used to transmit a signal.
**The program also creates backups of the creation in the certain creation folder.**

This glitch is based on the Scrap Mechanic game mechanic, which does not allow for 256 to be connected. But you can do it by hand, for this you need to connect 1 gate (input) to the “repeater”, i.e. to the other 256 gates, so you will get the max limit connected and then, by hand through Bingo Tool mod or Blueprint Editor through the notepad you need to add the ID of the output gate as an additional connection of the input gate, so you will get the same result.

The code is almost entirely written through artificial intelligence like Grok3 using ChatGPT and Deepseek for side.
